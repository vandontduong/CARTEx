# CARTEx: CAR T cell exhaustion signature

This is the github repository for the CAR T cell exhaustion (CARTEx) signature project. Pre-processing and analyses were performed using [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) and custom pipelines written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/#welcome-to-sherlock), a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster at Stanford University, was used for computation and storage. The purpose of this research was to develop a robust signature and procedure for quantifying T cell exhaustion states.

# About <a name = "about"></a>

Historically, T cell exhaustion was described based on a few canonical markers. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing has enabled high-resolution of transcriptomics and deeper insights underpinning cellular behavior, but many groups still identified "exhausted" T cells based on simple correlations with canonical markers (e.g. "PDCD1 is highly expressed in this cluster of cells, so these may be exhausted"). Using a robust model of CAR T cell exhaustion, we created a transcriptional signature to quantify T cell exhaustion. This signature was derived from differentially expressed genes between highly functional CD19 CAR T cells, exhaustion-prone HA CAR T cells, and control T cells. The HA CAR spontaneously aggregates and causes tonic signaling, which has been validated as a robust model of exhaustion in numerous studies ([Long et al. 2015 Nature Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25939063/), [Lynn et al. 2019 Nature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31802004/), [Gennert et al. 2021 PNAS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34285077/), [Weber et al. 2021 Science](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795428/)).

# Experiments <a name = "experiments"></a>

We derived the CARTEx signature from in-house experiments comparing highly functional CD19 CAR T cells, exhaustion-prone HA CAR T cells, and control T cells. We then applied the CARTEx signature to both in-house and publicly available experiments.

General procedure:

1. Prepare datasets
  - Extract CD8+ T cells (e.g. `CD8A_expression > 0 & CD8B_expression > 0 & CD4_expression == 0`)
  - Filter, normalize, scale, perform dimensional reduction, cluster cells
    - Modified pre-processing pipeline from [Seurat guided clustering tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial)
    - Filtered cell quality (e.g. `subset(expt.obj, subset = nFeature_RNA > 200 & nFeature_RNA < 6000 & percent.mt < 10)`)
  - Cell cycle analysis using modified pipeline from [Seurat cell cycle tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/cell_cycle_vignette.html)
  - Cell type annotation using reference-based [SingleR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleR.html)
  - Calculate cell state scores using Seurat [`AddModuleScore()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Seurat/versions/4.3.0/topics/AddModuleScore)
2. Integrate datasets
  - Reciprocal PCA integration using modified pipeline from [Seurat fast integration tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_rpca.html)
    - Increased strength of alignment (e.g. `k.anchor = 20`)
  - Calculate exhaustion signatures
3. Pseudo-bulk datasets
  - Aggregate cells using [`AggregateExpression`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/aggregateexpression) from [Seurat pseudo-bulk analysis tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/essential_commands.html#pseudobulk-analysis)
4. Calculate exhaustion signatures

Note, we do not include the raw or processed data for these experiments, as the file sizes are far too large. However, our scripts for preparing and exploring the datasets are shared in this repository. Publicly-available experiments can be downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
