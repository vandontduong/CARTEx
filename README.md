# CARTEx

## About

This is the github repository for the CARTEx signature project. Pre-processing and analyses were performed using Seurat and custom pipelines written in R.

## Datasets

We derived the CARTEx signature from in-house experiments involving functional CD19 CAR T cells, exhaustion-prone HA CAR T cells, and control T cells. We then applied the CARTEx signature to both in-house and publicly available experiments.

(add table of experiment IDs and descriptions)

Note, we do not include the raw or processed data for these experiments, as the file sizes are far too large. However, our scripts for preparing and exploring the datasets are shared in this repository. Publicly-available experiments can be downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
