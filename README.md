# CARTEx: CAR T cell exhaustion signature

This is the github repository for the CAR T cell exhaustion (CARTEx) signature project. Pre-processing and analyses were performed using [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) and custom pipelines written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/#welcome-to-sherlock), a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster at Stanford University, was used for computation and storage. The purpose of this research was to develop a robust signature and procedure for quantifying T cell exhaustion states.

# About <a name = "about"></a>

Historically, T cell exhaustion was described based on a few canonical markers. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing has enabled high-resolution of transcriptomics and deeper insights underpinning cellular behavior, but many groups still identified "exhausted" T cells based on simple correlations with canonical markers (e.g. "PDCD1 is highly expressed in this cluster of cells, so these may be exhausted"). Using a robust model of CAR T cell exhaustion, we created a transcriptional signature to quantify T cell exhaustion. This signature was derived from differentially expressed genes between highly functional CD19 CAR T cells, exhaustion-prone HA CAR T cells, and control T cells. The HA CAR spontaneously aggregates and causes tonic signaling, which has been validated as a robust model of exhaustion in numerous studies ([Long et al. 2015 Nature Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25939063/), [Lynn et al. 2019 Nature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31802004/), [Gennert et al. 2021 PNAS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34285077/), [Weber et al. 2021 Science](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795428/)).

# Experiments <a name = "experiments"></a>

We derived the CARTEx signature from in-house experiments comparing highly functional CD19 CAR T cells, exhaustion-prone HA CAR T cells, and control T cells. The scripts for identifying the gene set and constructing the weights are shared within [construction](construction). We then applied the CARTEx signature to both in-house and publicly-available experiments. Note, we do not include the raw or processed data for these experiments in the github repository, as the file sizes are far too large. However, our scripts for preparing and exploring the datasets are shared in this repository within [experiments](experiments). Publicly-available experiments can be downloaded from the [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).

General procedure for scRNAseq analyses:

1. Prepared datasets
  - Constructed Seurat objects `expt.obj` (for each experiment), `aging.obj` from [GSE136184](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE136184), and `ref.obj` from [GSE164378](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE164378)
    - `expt.obj`: Extracted CD8+ T cells (e.g. `CD8A_expression > 0 & CD8B_expression > 0 & CD4_expression == 0`)
    - `aging.obj`: Extracted disparate aging CD8+ T cell samples for cross-experiment comparisons based on exhaustion scores of naive T cells from newborns and young adults and terminally exhausted T cells from elderly adults
    - `ref.obj`: Extracted CD8+ T cells in PMBCs for reference mapping
  - Filtered, normalized, scaled, performed dimensional reduction, cluster cells
    - Modified pre-processing pipeline from [Seurat guided clustering tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial)
    - Filtered cell quality (e.g. `subset(expt.obj, subset = nFeature_RNA > 200 & nFeature_RNA < 6000 & percent.mt < 10)`)
  - Analyzed cell cycle phase using modified pipeline from [Seurat cell cycle tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/cell_cycle_vignette.html)
  - Annotated cell type using reference-based [SingleR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleR.html)
  - Calculated cell state scores using Seurat [`AddModuleScore()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Seurat/versions/4.3.0/topics/AddModuleScore)
2. Integrated datasets
  - Integrated with reference-based reciprocal PCA using modified pipeline from [Seurat fast integration tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_rpca.html) and [Seurat reference mapping tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_mapping.html)
    - Increased strength of alignment (e.g. `k.anchor = 20`)
  - Calculated exhaustion signatures on query datasets, which consists of `expt.obj` and `aging.obj`, but not `ref.obj`
3. Pseudo-bulk datasets
  - Aggregated cells using [`AggregateExpression`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/aggregateexpression) from [Seurat pseudo-bulk analysis tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/essential_commands.html#pseudobulk-analysis)
4. Calculated exhaustion signatures
