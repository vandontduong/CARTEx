# CARTEx: CAR T cell exhaustion signature

This is the github repository for the CAR T cell exhaustion (CARTEx) signature project. Pre-processing and analyses were performed using [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) and custom pipelines written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/#welcome-to-sherlock), a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster at Stanford University, was used for computation and storage. The purpose of this research was to develop a robust signature and procedure for quantifying T cell exhaustion states.

# About <a name = "about"></a>

Historically, T cell exhaustion was described based on a few canonical markers. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing has enabled high-resolution of transcriptomics and deeper insights underpinning cellular behavior, but many groups still identified "exhausted" T cells based on simple correlations with canonical markers (e.g. "PDCD1 is highly expressed in this cluster of cells, so these may be exhausted"). Using a robust model of CAR T cell exhaustion, we created a transcriptional signature to quantify T cell exhaustion. This signature was derived from differentially expressed genes between highly functional CD19 CAR T cells, exhaustion-prone HA CAR T cells, and control T cells. The HA CAR spontaneously aggregates and induces tonic signaling, which has been validated and used as a robust model of exhaustion in numerous studies ([Long et al. 2015 Nature Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25939063/), [Lynn et al. 2019 Nature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31802004/), [Gennert et al. 2021 PNAS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34285077/), [Weber et al. 2021 Science](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795428/), [Klysz et al. 2024 Cancer Cell](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37162847/)).

# Experiments <a name = "experiments"></a>

We derived the CARTEx signature from in-house experiments comparing highly functional CD19 CAR T cells, exhaustion-prone HA CAR T cells, and control T cells. The scripts for identifying the gene set and constructing the weights are shared within [construction](construction). We then applied the CARTEx signature to both in-house and publicly-available experiments. Note, we do not include the raw or processed data for these experiments in the github repository, as the file sizes are far too large. However, our scripts for preparing and exploring the datasets are shared in this repository within [experiments](experiments). Publicly-available experiments can be downloaded from the [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).

General procedure for scRNAseq analyses:

1. Prepared datasets
  - Constructed Seurat objects `expt.obj` (for each experiment), `aging.obj` from [GSE136184](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE136184), and `ref.obj` from [GSE164378](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE164378)
    - `expt.obj`: Extracted CD8+ T cells (e.g. `CD8A_expression > 0 & CD8B_expression > 0 & CD4_expression == 0`)
    - `aging.obj`: Extracted disparate aging CD8+ T cell samples for cross-experiment comparisons based on exhaustion scores of naive T cells from newborns and young adults and terminally exhausted T cells from elderly adults
    - `ref.obj`: Extracted CD8+ T cells in PMBCs for reference mapping
  - Modified pre-processing pipeline from [Seurat guided clustering tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial)
    - Filtered cell quality (e.g. `subset(expt.obj, subset = nFeature_RNA > 200 & nFeature_RNA < 6000 & percent.mt < 10)`)
    - Normalized counts by log transformation
    - Identified highly variable features
    - Scaled data to prepare for dimensionality reduction
    - Performed principal components analysis
    - Clustered cells using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with edges drawn between cells with similar gene expression patterns
  - Analyzed cell cycle phase using modified pipeline from [Seurat cell cycle tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/cell_cycle_vignette.html)
  - Annotated cell type using reference-based [SingleR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleR.html)
  - Calculated cell state scores using Seurat [`AddModuleScore()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Seurat/versions/4.3.0/topics/AddModuleScore)
  - Visualized annotated cells by embedding into Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) or diffusion maps
2. Integrated datasets
  - Integrated with reference-based reciprocal PCA using modified pipeline from [Seurat fast integration tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_rpca.html) and [Seurat reference mapping tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_mapping.html)
    - Increased strength of alignment (e.g. `k.anchor = 20`)
  - Calculated exhaustion signatures on query datasets, which consists of `expt.obj` and `aging.obj`, but not `ref.obj`
3. Pseudo-bulk datasets
  - Aggregated cells using [`AggregateExpression`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/aggregateexpression) from [Seurat pseudo-bulk analysis tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/essential_commands.html#pseudobulk-analysis)
4. Calculated exhaustion signatures

## Limitations of scRNAseq analysis <a name = "limitations"></a>

[Andrews et al. 2021 Nature Protocols](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-00409-w) describes common challenges with processing scRNAseq datasets, including quality control, differential expression, etc.

[Murphy and Skene 2022 Nature Communications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36550119/) describes the use of pseudobulk aggregation to address biased inference, which arises from subsampling cells from the same donor (i.e. identical genetic backgrounds).

[Li et al. 2023 Frontiers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37255988/) describes that the gene representation in single-cell methods is biased due to library preparation. It is likely that genes with enriched poly(G) motifs at the 3' end are underdetected as a result of hairpin structure formation with poly(A) tails.

[Grabski et al. 2023 Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01933-9) describes the challenges with clustering analysis in scRNAseq. The standard procedure with Seurat is to perform principial components analysis on log-transformed, normalize counts, compute Euclidean distances between top principal components for every pair of cells, identify nearest neighbors for each cell, assign a weight to every pair of cells, and define clusters in a way to maximize modularity. Such an approach does not evaluate the likelihood of over- or under-clustering, so there could be falsely discovered or undetected clusters. 

[Ahlmann-Eltze and Huber 2021 Bioinformatics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33295604/) describes the robust fitting of Gamma-Poisson distribution to single-cell data, which has frequent zero and small values due to sparse sampling.

[Zappia and Oshlack 2018 GigaScience](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30010766/) describes clustering trees as a visualization of clusterings across many resolutions.

[Böhm et al. 2022 Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3586589.3586684) describes neighborhood embeddings across attraction-repulsion spectrum.
