# CARTEx

## About

This is the github repository for the CARTEx signature project. Pre-processing and analyses were performed using Seurat and custom pipelines written in R.

## Datasets

We derived the CARTEx signature from in-house experiments involving functional CD19 CAR T cells, exhaustion-prone HA CAR T cells, and control T cells. We then applied the CARTEx signature to both in-house and publicly available experiments.
